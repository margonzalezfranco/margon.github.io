title: SXSW - Avatars for Virtual Reality
abstract: Creating realistic digital humans has become a center piece for the
  take-off VR and AI. Current VR worlds are widely underpopulated, and that
  prevents us from realizing the true potential of this technology. Humans are
  not only basic for a social metaverse but can also alter our own behavior and
  perceptual experience when representing users. There are many challenges
  related to this work that include advancements on avatar creation,
  accessibility, the use of look-alike avatars, overcoming the uncanny valley,
  tracking and sensing systems as well as real-time or procedural animation and
  finally achieving natural interaction and engagement in applications. This
  special session will invite key players in the field to discuss how to
  democratize avatars.
