abstract: For Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality to become the primary
  interaction device with digital content, beyond the form factor, we need to
  understand what types of things we can do in VR that would be impossible with
  other technologies. That is, what does spatial computing bring to the table.
  For once, the spatialization of our senses. We can enhance audio or
  proprioception in complete new ways. We can grab and touch objects with new
  controllers, like never before. Even in the empty space between our hands. But
  how fast do we adapt to the new sensory experiences? Can we change how we
  perceive our own bodies with Avatars? Avatars represent other humans but can
  also substitute our own bodies. And we perceive our world through our bodies.
  Hence avatars change our perception of our surroundings. In this Keynote we
  will explore the uniqueness of VR, from perception to avatars and how they can
  ultimately change our behavior and interactions with the digital content.

ACM SUI brings together top researchers and practitioners from around the world who focus on spatial interaction for Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and for real environments. SUI is a premier venue for presenting research on the design and use of technologies that focus on the challenges of interacting with the volumetric, 3D space we live in. This considers both spatial input and spatial output, with an emphasis on issues of interaction between humans and systems.

Due to recent advances in 3D technologies and in fields such as VR, spatial interaction is now more relevant than ever before. The symposium's goal is to support an intensive exchange between both industry and academic researchers working in this area and to foster new discussions among participants.
