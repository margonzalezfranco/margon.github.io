abstract: >-
  VR locomotion is still one of the unsolved frontiers in VR. Dr.
  Gonzalez-Franco will review the many possible options and techniques to
  implement and bridge the gap between reality and virtual world navigation.
  While some techniques are more accessible than others, nausea levels may
  become an issue with some of them.

  Microsoft researchers are looking for ways to achieve the best outcomes. Imagination is at play in defining how to interface large VR spaces in restricted physical areas. Concerns on navigation such as distance perception and distance compression depend on the level of embodied interaction. Making avatars is an unexpected key aspect of locomotion.

  Dr. Gonzalez-Franco will describe techniques that might have implications on the ability to create mental maps for users and go deep into all of these.

  You will also discover the newest techniques and learn from both academic, industry, as well as game design implementations.
